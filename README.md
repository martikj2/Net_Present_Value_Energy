# Net_Present_Value_Energy
Net present value of different low C energy sources. Runs "Monte-Carlo" by sampling parameters over some range
Created this in response to a DIW Berlin report "High-Priced and Dangerous: Nuclear Power Is Not an Option for the Climate-Friendly Energy Mix"
Report had a strange looking distribution of nuclear power net present value. Strange because it didn't seem consistent with the text explaining its basis.
Jupyter notebook implement similar sampling as in the report and also extends the same analysis to wind and solar power.
