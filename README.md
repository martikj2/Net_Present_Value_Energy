# Net_Present_Value_Energy
Net present value of different low C energy sources. Runs "Monte-Carlo" by sampling parameters over some range
Created this in response to a DIW Berlin report "High-Priced and Dangerous: Nuclear Power Is Not an Option for the Climate-Friendly Energy Mix"
Report had a strange looking distribution of nuclear power net present value. Strange because it didn't seem consistent with the text explaining its basis. Results should be compared with Figure 2 in  https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.670590.de/publikationen/weekly_reports/high_priced_and_dangerous_nuclear_power_is_not_an_option_for_the_climate_friendly_energy_mix.html

Jupyter notebook implements similar sampling as in the report and also extends the same analysis to wind and solar power.
